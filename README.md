## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Errors**
```powershell
# Clear Next.js cache
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next
npm run build
```

**Auth0 Issues**
- Verify all AUTH0_* environment variables are set correctly
- Check that AUTH0_BASE_URL matches your deployment domain
- Ensure Auth0 application callback URLs include your domain

**KV Storage Issues**
- Referral features require KV_REST_API_URL and KV_REST_API_TOKEN in production
- App falls back to local-only storage if KV is unavailable
- Check Vercel dashboard for KV configuration

**LinkedIn Integration**
- PROXYCURL_API_KEY is optional - app works without LinkedIn tracking
- Rate limits may cause temporary follower count update delays
- Verify LinkedIn profile URLs are publicly accessible

### Development Tips
- Use `npm run dev` for hot reloading during development
- Check browser console for client-side errors and state issues
- Use Vercel CLI for easy deployment and environment variable management
